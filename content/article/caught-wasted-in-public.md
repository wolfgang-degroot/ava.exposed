Last Tuesday afternoon,
The MPD responded to a disturbance call at a local Comfort Suites.
First responders arrived at a scene of terror and destruction as
Ava was armed and robbing every guest of their wallets and alcohol.
The cat was in a drunken craze and was unable to be detained.
All officers on the scene left with scratches
on their hands, arms, and legs from the cat in question.
While the injured officers were receiving medical attention,
Ava hijacked a police cruiser and left the scene.

Driving south-northbound,
Ava showed no considerations for any driving laws or practices.
She sped multitudes past the speed limit on
not just both sides of the roads- but their sidewalks as well.
She had no overall sense of direction and
seemed to avoid what she would run into at the moment.
Due to her small size due to being a cat,
anything shorter than 20 feet was effectively invisible to her.
Due to this, she would often crash into or drive over them.

	"ythhjyuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu" -
	Ava, walking over an editor's keyboard as they typed this.
	We chose to keep it in, so she has a fair say on what she's done.

Back at the hotel, investigators were searching Ava's room.
Found scattered among were several bottles of hard liquor, all of which Ava stole.
The majority of these were empty,
all tipped over next to red plastic cups-
molded into the shape of cat bowls.
The team of specialists were unable to tell what happened there,
and could only infer that the bottles were there before and simply spilled over.
They left the scene with no leads,
carrying out the final few filled bottles under their jackets.
        
Ava drove the stolen cruiser into a dry reservoir and
escaped custody as she crawled into a rainwater drainage pipe.
By this point, the entire LEA was sharing the busted alcohol,
and by Wednesday morning,
had completely forgotten what they were going after.
Not believing it was a single cat when told,
the investigation stopped,
and the state dropped all charges.
