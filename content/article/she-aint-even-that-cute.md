We sat in a dark room.
The lights flickered on and off with little pattern.
The hum of a running refrigerator,
The contents of which emitted a foul odor.
After we sat for ten minutes,
Dr. Huang burst open the doors and welcomed us after he caught his breath.
    
Before we could ask questions,
He began to mumble about Ava incoherently before proclaiming to nobody in particular
*“…and I have proof!”*
as his eyes darted around the room.
After staring into the ceiling for fifteen seconds,
he burst into a back room,
coming out several minutes later with a large, wet stack of paper.
    
*“This cat!”*
He said in a calmer tone than his previous demeanor.
He continued:
*“Look at her, look at the way her nose is like… Look at the… She ain't even that cute!”*
He was audibly snarling at the sight of the photo, which he grasped firmly.

He threw the prints onto a table, scattering them.
The clutter revealed among the pictures of Ava several crude drawings of the cat in question,
clumps of her fur, and a stock photo of a litter box.
He grabbed a marker and began scribbling circles on a photo of her.
After seven rough circles on arbitrary parts of her,
he traced lines between them in a web of irrelevant connections.
He threw the composite onto the disordered stack, and
shoved them violently into the faces of the press.
*“The signs are all here. She's no good.”*
    
He had us firmly convinced and in a collective agreement.

After scratching at his face with his free hand,
He began to mumble about Ava's supposed ugliness.
He then ran across the room, and then tripped over the loose paper and dropped.
He told the press to leave and never come back.
Four days later, a missing person report filed for Dr. Huang,
who was not present at either his workplace or his home and was uncontactable.

If you have seen Dr. Huang,
please immediately contact the FBI Memphis Field Office.
