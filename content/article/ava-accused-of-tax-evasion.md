On May 15th, the IRS gained a warrant to search Ava's house.
The next day, they broke in and searched the entire building.
They found several shredded up tax forms by a litter box and
discovered her cat bed, overflowed with old $50 bills.

Deputy Aries arrived on the scene,
his cowboy boots slamming on the floor and spurs spinning.
He whipped a revolver out of his satchel and
shot the wall for no apparent reason.
After apologizing using as much southern slang as possible,
He hopped up onto the couch and passed out.

Ava responded to the investigation and allegations,
declaring *"Mraaaaooowww."*
She then slumped onto the floor and curled up into a ball.
All investigators paused to pet her with great joy.
Unfortunately, all evidence was set aflame by Ava moments prior,
which halted the investigation until further notice.

Deputy Aries claimed that the investigation was no total loss,
because he noted that Ava's fur felt quite soft.
