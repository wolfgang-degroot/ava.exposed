#	AVA EXPOSED
##	3rd Generation

This repository is a port of the old PHP-based ava.exposed to a more robust solution.
Powered by Zola to generate static HTML files rather than executing a script,
this site is now a lot more stable and fast.

In addition, it brings a few QOL changes and a moderate stylistic overhaul.
You know, As much as you *could* have for a site this small in scope.
